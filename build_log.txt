┌─ Flutter Fix ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ The plugin record_android requires a higher Android SDK version.                              │
│ Fix this issue by adding the following to the file C:\Users\azizb\Desktop\Project\projet      │
│ flutter\flutter\android\app\build.gradle:                                                     │
│ android {                                                                                     │
│   defaultConfig {                                                                             │
│     minSdkVersion 23                                                                          │

│ Following this change, your app will not be available to users running Android SDKs below 23. │
│ Consider searching for a version of this plugin that supports these lower versions of the     │
│ Android SDK instead.                                                                          │
